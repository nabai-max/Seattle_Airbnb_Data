# Seattle_Airbnb_Data

Seattle is one of the most visited cities in the United States. And as Airbnb is getting popular year over year, travelers like me like to book a roon on Airbnb. I travelled to more than 40 countries, and Airbnb is always my first choice, as it has a home like room, more importantly, it is much cheaper comparing to the hotels.
So, if you are traveling to Seattle, and want to book a room on Airbnb, you may wonder, what month has the highest availability and which month is the cheapest? what will affect the price of the room?
To answer the questions above, I analyzed the 2016 data of Seattle Airbnb, if you are interested, you can dowanload the data here. There are three data sets; Calendar includes the listing_id, date, available and price. Listing includes the details of the room, such as name, description, neighborhood, cancellation_policy, etc. The last dataset is reviews, which has all the review information.

Using basic data analysis, I have some findings. The availability dropped in June, July and August and it increased in December and January.
There are many factors affect the price of the room, such as accomodates, number of bedrooms, number of beds, cleaning_fee, and number of bathrooms.
